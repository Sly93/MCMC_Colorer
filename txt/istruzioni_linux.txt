datasetGen generates a random Erdos graph and saves it in a format which is compatible with the colorer. It requires four parameters:
./datasetGen <number_of_nodes> <data_file> <label_file> <edge_probabilty>
- number of nodes: ...
- label file: output filename for the labels (unused in this project, but still required in the executable)
- data file: output filename for the graph
- edge probability: probability of creating an edge between nodes i and j, with 0 < i < number_of_nodes, and 0 < j < number_of_nodes. Being a probability, it is required to be a float number, 0 < p < 1

example: ./datasetGen 32 lab.txt net.txt 0.2

MCMC_Colorer is the main executable, and includes code for different colorers:
- Luby, GPU version, implemented for a single CPU thread and a NVidia GPU (kept for reference)
- MCMC, CPU version, implemented for a single thread
- MCMC, GPU version, implemented for a single CPU thread and a NVidia GPU
It can be invoked by:
./MCMC_Colorer --label <label_file> --data <data_file> --gene <gene_file>
- <label_file> a label file generated by the datesetGet utility (unused in this project, but still required in the executable)
- <data_file> a data file generated by the datasetGen utility
- <gene_file> (unused in this project, but still required in the executable) can be a random name

example: ./MCMC_Colorer --data net.txt --label lab.txt --gene gene.txt

per cancellare tutto: rm -rf build

per mostrare file dettagliatamente: ls -l
file nascosti:						ls -a
cartelle con /:						ls -F

in dalab:
- fai una nuova cartella build2 e spostatici dentro
- nuovo comando cmake: 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.8 CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.8 cmake ../src
questo forza ad usare una versione più vecchia di gcc
- compilazione usuale (make -j 8)
